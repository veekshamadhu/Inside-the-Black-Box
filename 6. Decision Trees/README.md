This folder is designed to give you a theoretical and computational understanding of decision trees.
Start by reading the Decision Trees PDF to understand the statistics and mathematics behind the algorithm. Use the code file once you have thoroughly understood the PDF, and use the 'Can We Build it? Yes, We Can!' section to accompany you through the code. The data extraction and feature engineering folder contains SQL code that builds the data from an SQL database. The source of the dataset was spread across several tables in a database, so tables had to be joined so relevant features could be engineered and selected. Finally, if you want to reproduce the model, use the EUfootball2.csv dataset to do so.

Best of luck, and have fun!
