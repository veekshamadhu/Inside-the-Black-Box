This folder is designed to give you a theoretical and computational understanding of multiple linear regressions.
Start by reading the Multiple Linear Regressions PDF to understand the statistics and mathematics behind the algorithm. Use the code file once you have thoroughly understood the PDF, and use the 'Can We Build it? Yes, We Can!' section to accompany you through the code. If you are interested in the anomaly detection process, go through c. MLR_anomoly_removal. Finally, if you want to reproduce the model, use the Housing_cleaned.csv dataset to do so.

Best of luck, and have fun!
