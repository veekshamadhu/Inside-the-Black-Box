This folder is designed to give you a theoretical and computational understanding of logistic regressions.
Start by reading the Logistic Regressions PDF to understand the statistics and mathematics behind the algorithm. Use the code file once you have thoroughly understood the PDF, and use the 'Can We Build it? Yes, We Can!' section to accompany you through the code. Finally, if you want to reproduce the model, use the parkinsons.data dataset to do so.

Best of luck, and have fun!
