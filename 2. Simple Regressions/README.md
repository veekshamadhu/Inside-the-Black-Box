  This folder is designed to give you a theoretical and computational understanding of simple linear regressions. 
  Start by reading the Simple Linear Regressions PDF to understand the statistics and mathematics behind the algorithm. Use the code file once you have thoroughly understood the PDF, and use the 'Can We Build it? Yes, We Can!' section to accompany you through the code. Finally, if you want to reproduce the model, use the Housing.csv dataset to do so.

  Best of luck, and have fun!
