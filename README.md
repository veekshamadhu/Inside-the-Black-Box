# Into-the-Black-Box
What’s going on inside the ‘black box’? In machine learning, when we call something a ‘black box’, we mean that the internal process is hidden from us. scikit-learn makes it easy to use their in-built functions, but we still want to understand what’s going on inside.

Inside the Black Box dives deep into the math and statistics that power machine learning models. My posts break apart popular algorithms—exploring both the theory and intuition—before building them back up with hands-on code. You’ll find models built with scikit-learn alongside step-by-step manual implementations, making it easy to see how each piece fits together and how predictions are made. Plus, each post features unique and creative visualizations—including 3D plots and unconventional ways to depict data and model behavior. If you love understanding not just what works, but why it works, you’re in the right place!
