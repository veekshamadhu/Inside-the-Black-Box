# Into-the-Black-Box

Inside the Black Box dives deep into the math and statistics that power machine learning models. My posts break apart popular algorithms—exploring both the theory and intuition—before building them back up with hands-on code. You’ll find models built with scikit-learn alongside step-by-step manual implementations, making it easy to see how each piece fits together and how predictions are made. If you love understanding not just what works, but why it works, you’re in the right place!
